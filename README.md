# Wikihistor

This project is an ongoing effort to develop a tool for users to easily learn and retain information from Wikipedia articles using a flashcard-like approach. Please note that this project is not finished and is being used for educational purposes in my university classes. It is an individual project, not a group project.

It uses Java Spring to categorize and present Wikipedia articles in a flashcard format. Users can select articles of interest and create flashcards to aid in learning and retention of the information.

The name Wikihistor is a blend of Wikipedia and polyhistor.
